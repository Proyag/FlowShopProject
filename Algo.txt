1.	Initial sequence of n jobs in ascending order. [0 1 2 …. n]
2.	Start with 4 jobs [0 1 2 3]. Permute 4! = 24 sequences. Set i=4.
3.	Calculate makespan for each of the 24 sequences (using only the corresponding rows of the matrix to calculate). Arrange in ascending order of makespan.
4.	Select best 20 sequences.
5.	Clone using RWS to have 3 * 20 = 60 sequences.
6.	Select best 20 sequences.
7.	For each of 20 sequences, apply Ordered Crossover with the other 19 sequences. => 20 * 19 = 380 sequences.
8.	Select best 20 sequences.
9.	Apply Mutation (tried different types) on each of the 20 sequences to get 20 more sequences => 40 sequences.
10.	Select best 20 sequences.
11.	Increment i. If i>n goto Step 14.
12.	Add i-th job to each of the 20 sequences to each possible position.
13.	Goto step 4.
14.	Select the best sequence.
